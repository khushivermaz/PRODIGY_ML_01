## House Price Prediction Model
## This project focuses on predicting house prices using multivariate linear regression. It utilizes data from the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition on Kaggle.

## Project Overview
In this project, I implemented a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as the size of the house, location, year built, and other property characteristics. The project focuses on data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
